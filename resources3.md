Perfect, thanks for clarifying. Since youâ€™ve already done part of **Nand2Tetris** (built an assembler, know VM concept), youâ€™re in a good place for Corewar. The difference here is:

* Nand2Tetris â†’ build an assembler & VM for a toy CPU you already know the ISA for.
* Corewar â†’ youâ€™re given the ISA (instruction set) and must build both the **assembler** (text â†’ binary) and the **virtual machine** (binary execution in a simulated CPU/memory arena).

So what you need now are **resources to learn Corewar itself**, not assembler basics again.

## âœ… Suggested Learning Path

1. **Play with Corewar first**

   * Download existing VM + assembler (from repos above).
   * Run sample warriors (`ameba.s`, etc.).
   * Observe how `.s` â†’ `.cor` â†’ VM fight works.

2. **Study the Assembly language**

   * Focus on how parameters work: registers (`rX`), direct (`%X`), indirect (`X`).
   * Learn `live`, `ld`, `st`, `zjmp`, `fork` first â†’ these form the "heartbeat" of the game.

3. **Build Assembler**

   * Parse `.s` â†’ validate â†’ generate `.cor`.
   * Use `hexdump` to compare with reference binaries.

4. **Build VM**

   * Implement arena (circular memory).
   * Load players at even offsets.
   * Execute cycle by cycle (fetch, decode, execute).
   * Handle processes, PC, carry, `CYCLE_TO_DIE`.

5. **Test**

   * Compare your VM output against reference VM.
   * Write your own simple warrior and fight against `ameba`.

âš¡ Since you already built an assembler before (in Nand2Tetris), this project will feel familiar at first, but the **challenge is the VMâ€™s process handling + timing**.

---

Do you want me to **map Corewarâ€™s assembler/VM design directly to what you did in Nand2Tetris** (so you can reuse that mental model), or just give you a clean design plan for Corewar from scratch?
